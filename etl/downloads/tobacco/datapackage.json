  "description": "This dataset contains two data files: 1) Adult cigarette use prevalence and 2) Adult tobacco use prevalence in California.  Tobacco use includes cigarettes, cigars, little cigars or cigarillos, pipe tobacco, smokeless tobacco (e.g. chew, snuff, snus), hookah, or electronic smoking devices (e.g. e-cigarettes, vape pens, pod mods). See the individual file description for more information on each data file.\r\n\r\nThe California Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is an on-going telephone survey of randomly selected adults, which collects information on a wide variety of health-related behaviors, including current cigarette and tobacco usage. Data are collected monthly from a random sample of the California population aged 18 years and older. The BRFSS has been conducted since 1984 by the California Department of Public Health in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). ",

      "description": "The data table contains the adult smoking prevalence in California from the California Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) since 1984. Current cigarette smoking is defined as having smoked at least 100 cigarettes lifetime and now smoking everyday or smoke some days. The percentage is also broken down by gender. Caution must be used when comparing the percentages of smokers over time as the definition of “current smoker” was broadened in 1996 and the survey methods were changed in 2012. Prior to 1996, the definition of current cigarettes smoking was having smoked at least 100 cigarettes in lifetime and smoking now. Due to the methodology change in 2012, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) does not recommend conducting analyses where estimates prior to 2011 are compared with analyses using the new methodology.",
