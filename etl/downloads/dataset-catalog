Some CWP Objectives do not have program leads, data sources, baselines, and/or targets, but are included because they were a result of CDPH program or partner input and were felt to be important to the reduction of chronic disease incidence, prevalence, and health disparities. Agencies, programs and/or partners identified with an objective may be either data stewards and/or engaged in activities to achieve the target, but may not have adequate resources for statewide activities.  Developmental Objectives will be updated as information becomes available. 

Background: The California Wellness Plan, California's Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion Plan was released February 2014 by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH).  The overarching goal of CWP is Equity in Health and Wellbeing; additional CWP Goals include: 1) Healthy Communities, 2) Optimal Health Systems Linked with Community Prevention, 3) Accessible and Usable Health Information, and 4) Prevention  Sustainability and Capacity. All CWP objectives fall under the framework of Let's Get Healthy California Task Force priorities.

41,"CDPH-Wastewater Surveillance Data, California","The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) is coordinating with wastewater utilities, local health departments, academic researchers, and laboratories in California on wastewater surveillance for infectious disease pathogens of interest to public health (such as SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), mpox, and norovirus). Data collected from this network of participants, called the California Surveillance of Wastewaters (Cal-SuWers) Network, are submitted to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Wastewater Surveillance System (NWSS). 

Collecting and analyzing wastewater samples for the presence of, and amount of (concentration), a specified pathogen target can help inform public health about circulation of that infectious disease within a community. Data from wastewater testing do not replace existing public health surveillance systems but complement them. While wastewater surveillance cannot determine the exact number of infected persons in the area being monitored, it can provide overall trends of pathogen concentration within that community. 

Please note that data included in the Cal-SuWers Network and available here originate from multiple programs and laboratories. Methodologies for producing wastewater data are not currently standardized, and analyses, comparisons, and aggregations should be done with caution. Wastewater is a complex environmental sample and inherent variability in measured concentrations is expected due to environmental variability, day-to-day differences in sewershed and population dynamics, differences in the amount of shedding between people and pathogens, and laboratory and sampling variability. Please see the CDPH Cal-SuWers, CDC NWSS, and CDC Public Health interpretation and Use of Wastewater Surveillance data webpages for more information.

44,COVID-19 Blueprint for a Safer Economy Data Chart (ARCHIVED),"__Note__: Blueprint has been retired as of June 15, 2021. This dataset will be kept up for historical purposes, but will no longer be updated.

California has a new blueprint for reducing COVID-19 in the state with revised criteria for loosening and tightening restrictions on activities. Every county in California is assigned to a tier based on its test positivity and adjusted case rate for tier assignment. Additionally, a new health equity metric took effect on October 6, 2020. In order to advance to the next less restrictive tier, each county will need to meet an equity metric or demonstrate targeted investments to eliminate disparities in levels of COVID-19 transmission, depending on its size. The California Health Equity Metric is designed to help guide counties in their continuing efforts to reduce COVID-19 cases in all communities and requires more intensive efforts to prevent and mitigate the spread of COVID-19 among Californians who have been disproportionately impacted by this pandemic.

Please see https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/COVID19CountyMonitoringOverview.aspx for more information.

Also, in lieu of a Data Dictionary, please refer to the detailed explanation of the data columns in Appendix 1 of the above webpage.

45,COVID-19 Equity Metrics (PAUSED),"__Note:__ This dataset is on hiatus.

CDPH strives to respond equitably to the COVID-19 pandemic and is therefore interested in how different communities are impacted. Collecting and reporting health equity data helps to identify health disparities and improve the state’s response. To that end, CDPH tracks cases, deaths, and testing by race and ethnicity as well as other social determinants of health, such as income, crowded housing, and access to health insurance.

During the response, CDPH used a health equity metric, defined as the positivity rate in the most disproportionately-impacted communities according to the Healthy Places Index. The purpose of this metric was to ensure California reopened its economy safely by reducing disease transmission in all communities. This metric is tracked and reported in comparison to statewide positivity rate. More information is available at https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/CaliforniaHealthEquityMetric.aspx.

Data completeness is also critical to addressing inequities. CDPH reports data completeness by race and ethnicity, sexual orientation, and gender identity to better understand missingness in the data.

Health equity data is updated weekly. Data may be suppressed based on county population or total counts.

47,COVID-19 Outbreak Data (ARCHIVED),"__Note: This dataset is no longer being updated as of June 2, 2025.__

This dataset contains numbers of COVID-19 outbreaks and associated cases, categorized by setting, reported to CDPH since January 1, 2021.

AB 685 (Chapter 84, Statutes of 2020) and the Cal/OSHA COVID-19 Emergency Temporary Standards (Title 8, Subchapter 7, Sections 3205-3205.4) required non-healthcare employers in California to report workplace COVID-19 outbreaks to their local health department (LHD) between January 1, 2021 – December 31, 2022. Beginning January 1, 2023, non-healthcare employer reporting of COVID-19 outbreaks to local health departments is voluntary, unless a local order is in place. More recent data collected without mandated reporting may therefore be less representative of all outbreaks that have occurred, compared to earlier data collected during mandated reporting. Licensed health facilities continue to be mandated to report outbreaks to LHDs.

LHDs report confirmed outbreaks to the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) via the California Reportable Disease Information Exchange (CalREDIE), the California Connected (CalCONNECT) system, or other established processes. Data are compiled and categorized by setting by CDPH. Settings are categorized by U.S. Census industry codes. Total outbreaks and cases are included for individual industries as well as for broader industrial sectors.

The first dataset includes numbers of outbreaks in each setting by month of onset, for outbreaks reported to CDPH since January 1, 2021. This dataset includes some outbreaks with onset prior to January 1 that were reported to CDPH after January 1; these outbreaks are denoted with month of onset “Before Jan 2021.” The second dataset includes cumulative numbers of COVID-19 outbreaks with onset after January 1, 2021, categorized by setting. Due to reporting delays, the reported numbers may not reflect all outbreaks that have occurred as of the reporting date; additional outbreaks may have occurred that have not yet been reported to CDPH.

While many of these settings are workplaces, cases may have occurred among workers, other community members who visited the setting, or both. Accordingly, these data do not distinguish between outbreaks involving only workers, outbreaks involving only residents or patrons, or outbreaks involving both.

Several additional data limitations should be kept in mind:

* Outbreaks are classified as “Insufficient information” for outbreaks where not enough information was available for CDPH to assign an industry code.

* Some sectors, particularly congregate residential settings, may have increased testing and therefore increased likelihood of outbreak recognition and reporting. As a result, in congregate residential settings, the number of outbreak-associated cases may be more accurate.

* However, in most settings, outbreak and case counts are likely underestimates. For most cases, it is not possible to identify the source of exposure, as many cases have multiple possible exposures.

* Because some settings have been at times been closed or open with capacity restrictions, numbers of outbreak reports in those settings do not reflect COVID-19 transmission risk.

* The number of outbreaks in different settings will depend on the number of different workplaces in each setting. More outbreaks would be expected in settings with many workplaces compared to settings with few workplaces.",California Department of Public Health,"COVID-19 Response Data, Informatics, Surveillance, Clinical and Outbreaks (DISCO) Team",opendata@cdph.ca.gov,https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/ncov2019.aspx,See dataset title,California,statewide,English,monthly,"","","",Terms of Use,Limitations,"","","","","",2020-12-18T23:36:39.047963,2025-11-07T00:09:09.853173,Diseases and Conditions,"",https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/covid-19-outbreak-data,covid-19-outbreak-data

50,COVID-19 Post-Vaccination Infection Data (ARCHIVED),"__Note:__ This dataset is no longer being updated due to the end of the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency.

The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) is identifying vaccination status of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths by analyzing the state immunization registry and registry of confirmed COVID-19 cases. Post-vaccination cases are individuals who have a positive SARS-Cov-2 molecular test (e.g. PCR) at least 14 days after they have completed their primary vaccination series.

Tracking cases of COVID-19 that occur after vaccination is important for monitoring the impact of immunization campaigns. While COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective, some cases are still expected in persons who have been vaccinated, as no vaccine is 100% effective. For more information, please see https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Post-Vaccine-COVID19-Cases.aspx

Post-vaccination infection data is updated monthly and includes data on cases, hospitalizations, and deaths among the unvaccinated and the vaccinated. Partially vaccinated individuals are excluded. To account for reporting and processing delays, there is at least a one-month lag in provided data (for example data published on 9/9/22 will include data through 7/31/22). 

Notes:

*  On September 9, 2022, the post-vaccination data has been changed to compare unvaccinated with those with at least a primary series completed for persons age 5+. These data will be updated monthly (first Thursday of the month) and include at least a one month lag.

*  On February 2, 2022, the post-vaccination data has been changed to distinguish between vaccination with a primary series only versus vaccinated and boosted. The previous dataset has been uploaded as an archived table. Additionally, the lag on this data has been extended to 14 days.

*  On November 29, 2021, the denominator for calculating vaccine coverage has been changed from age 16+ to age 12+ to reflect new vaccine eligibility criteria. The previous dataset based on age 16+ denominators has been uploaded as an archived table.

51,COVID-19 Probable Cases (ARCHIVED),"__Note:__ This dataset is no longer being updated due to the end of the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency.

__Note:__ On 2/16/22, 17,467 cases based on at-home positive test results were excluded from the probable case counts. Per national case classification guidelines, cases based on at-home positive results are now classified as “suspect” cases. The majority of these cases were identified between November 2021 and February 2022. 

CDPH tracks both probable and confirmed cases of COVID-19 to better understand how the virus is impacting our communities. Probable cases are defined as individuals with a positive antigen test that detects the presence of viral antigens. Antigen testing is useful when rapid results are needed, or in settings where laboratory resources may be limited. Confirmed cases are defined as individuals with a positive molecular test, which tests for viral genetic material, such as a PCR or polymerase chain reaction test. Results from both types of tests are reported to CDPH.

Due to the expanded use of antigen testing, surveillance of probable cases is increasingly important. The proportion of probable cases among the total cases in California has increased.  To provide a more complete picture of trends in case volume, it is now more important to provide probable case data in addition to confirmed case data. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has begun publishing probable case data for states. 

Testing data is updated weekly. Due to small numbers, the percentage of probable cases in the first two weeks of the month may change. Probable case data from San Diego County is not included in the statewide table at this time.

As of August 17, 2023, data is being updated each Friday.

For death data after December 31, 2022, California uses Provisional Deaths from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) National Vital Statistics System (NVSS). Prior to January 1, 2023, death data was sourced from the COVID-19 registry. The change in data source occurred in July 2023 and was applied retroactively to all 2023 data to provide a consistent source of death data for the year of 2023. 

As of May 11, 2023, data on cases, deaths, and testing is being updated each Thursday. Metrics by report date have been removed, but previous versions of files with report date metrics are archived below.

All metrics include people in state and federal prisons, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities, US Marshal detention facilities, and Department of State Hospitals facilities. Members of California's tribal communities are also included.

The ""Total Tests"" and ""Positive Tests"" columns show totals based on the collection date. There is a lag between when a specimen is collected and when it is reported in this dataset. As a result, the most recent dates on the table will temporarily show NONE in the ""Total Tests"" and ""Positive Tests"" columns.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that certain groups, including adults ages 65 years and older, receive additional doses.

On 6/16/2023 CDPH replaced the booster measures with a new “Up to Date” measure based on CDC’s new recommendations, replacing the primary series, boosted, and bivalent booster metrics The definition of “primary series complete” has not changed and is based on previous recommendations that CDC has since simplified. A person cannot complete their primary series with a single dose of an updated vaccine. Whereas the booster measures were calculated using the eligible population as the denominator, the new up to date measure uses the total estimated population. Please note that the rates for some groups may change since the up to date measure is calculated differently than the previous booster and bivalent measures.

This data is from the same source as the Vaccine Progress Dashboard at https://covid19.ca.gov/vaccination-progress-data/ which summarizes vaccination data at the county level by county of residence. Where county of residence was not reported in a vaccination record, the county of provider that vaccinated the resident is included. This applies to less than 1% of vaccination records. The sum of county-level vaccinations does not equal statewide total vaccinations due to out-of-state residents vaccinated in California.

These data do not include doses administered by the following federal agencies who received vaccine allocated directly from CDC: Indian Health Service, Veterans Health Administration, Department of Defense, and the Federal Bureau of Prisons.

Totals for the Vaccine Progress Dashboard and this dataset may not match, as the Dashboard totals doses by Report Date and this dataset totals doses by Administration Date. Dose numbers may also change for a particular Administration Date as data is updated.

Previous updates:

*  On March 3, 2023, with the release of HPI 3.0 in 2022, the previous equity scores have been updated to reflect more recent community survey information. This change represents an improvement to the way CDPH monitors health equity by using the latest and most accurate community data available. The HPI uses a collection of data sources and indicators to calculate a measure of community conditions ranging from the most to the least healthy based on economic, housing, and environmental measures.

*  Starting on July 13, 2022, the denominator for calculating vaccine coverage has been changed from age 5+ to all ages to reflect new vaccine eligibility criteria. Previously the denominator was changed from age 16+ to age 12+ on May 18, 2021, then changed from age 12+ to age 5+ on November 10, 2021, to reflect previous changes in vaccine eligibility criteria.  The previous datasets based on age 16+ and age 5+ denominators have been uploaded as archived tables.

This dataset shows full, partial, and at least 1 dose coverage rates by zip code tabulation area (ZCTA) for the state of California. Data sources include the California Immunization Registry and the American Community Survey’s 2015-2019 5-Year data.

This is the data table for the [LHJ Vaccine Equity Performance dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/profile/ca.open.data#!/vizhome/LHJVaccineEquityPerformance/MapView?publish=yes). However, this data table also includes ZTCAs that do not have a VEM score.

This dataset also includes Vaccine Equity Metric score quartiles (when applicable), which combine the Public Health Alliance of Southern California’s Healthy Places Index (HPI) measure with CDPH-derived scores to estimate factors that impact health, like income, education, and access to health care. ZTCAs range from less healthy community conditions in Quartile 1 to more healthy community conditions in Quartile 4.

The Vaccine Equity Metric is for weekly vaccination allocation and reporting purposes only. CDPH-derived quartiles should not be considered as indicative of the HPI score for these zip codes. CDPH-derived quartiles were assigned to zip codes excluded from the HPI score produced by the Public Health Alliance of Southern California due to concerns with statistical reliability and validity in populations smaller than 1,500 or where more than 50% of the population resides in a group setting.

These data do not include doses administered by the following federal agencies who received vaccine allocated directly from CDC: Indian Health Service, Veterans Health Administration, Department of Defense, and the Federal Bureau of Prisons.

For some ZTCAs, vaccination coverage may exceed 100%. This may be a result of many people from outside the county coming to that ZTCA to get their vaccine and providers reporting the county of administration as the county of residence, and/or the DOF estimates of the population in that ZTCA are too low.

58,COVID-19 Variant Data (ARCHIVED),"__Note:__ This dataset is no longer being updated due to the end of the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency.

The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) is identifying ​the prevalence of circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants by analyzing ​CDPH Genomic Surveillance Data and ​CalREDIE, CDPH's communicable disease reporting and surveillance system. Viruses mutate into new strains or variants over time. Some variants emerge and then disappear. Other variants become common and circulate for a long time. Several specialized laboratories statewide sequence the genomes of a fraction of all positive COVID-19 tests to determine which variants are circulating. Sequencing and reporting of variant results takes several days after a test is identified as a positive for COVID-19. Not all ​viruses from positive COVID-19 tests are ​sequenced. Knowing what variants are circulating in California informs public health and clinical action.

Note: There is a natural reporting lag in these data due to the time commitment to complete whole genome sequencing; therefore, a 14 day lag is applied to these datasets to allow for data completeness. Please note that more recent data should be used with caution.

Data displayed in this table represent California adults who met the aerobic recommendation for physical activity, as defined by the 2008 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans and Objectives 2.1 and 2.2 of Healthy People 2020.

The California Dietary Practices Surveys (CDPS) (now discontinued) was the most extensive dietary and physical activity assessment of adults 18 years and older in the state of California. CDPS was designed in 1989 and was administered biennially in odd years up through 2013.  The CDPS was designed to monitor dietary trends, especially fruit and vegetable consumption, among California adults for evaluating their progress toward meeting the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the Healthy People 2020 Objectives. For the data in this table, adults were asked a series of eight questions about their physical activity practices in the last month. Questions included: 1) During the past month, other than your regular job, did you participate in any physical activities or exercise such as running, calisthenics, golf, gardening or walking for exercise?  2) What type of physical activity or exercise did you spend the most time doing during the past month?  3) How many times per week or per month did you take part   n this activity during the past month?  4) And when you took part in this activity, for how many minutes or hours did you usually keep at it?  5) During the past month, how many times per week or per month did you do physical activities or exercises to strengthen your muscles? Questions 2, 3, and 4 were repeated to collect a second activity.

Each item is uniquely identified by a Universal Product Code (UPC) or Price Look-Up code (PLU) for WIC electronic benefit transfer (EBT). The WIC Authorized vendors use the CA Authorized Product List (APL) to transact WIC food items at cash registers. The APL plays a crucial role in supporting WIC EBT purchases. WIC EBT requires vendor systems to maintain the APL to match the scanned food items' UPCs to ensure they are on the APL. The food items identified by UPC and PLU can be found in the data files below. When you download the files, Excel may prompt you to automatically format the data. If prompted, you may want to hit ‘Don’t Convert’ so that Excel leaves the data as is without any formatting or data conversions.

The Women, Infants and Children (WIC) Program is a federally-funded health and nutrition program that provides assistance to pregnant women, new mothers, infants, and children under age five. WIC helps California families by providing food benefits to individual participants based on their nutritional need and risk assessment. The food benefits can be used to purchase healthy supplemental foods from approximately 3,800 WIC authorized vendor stores throughout the State. WIC also provides nutritional education, breastfeeding support, healthcare referrals, and other community services. Participants must meet income guidelines and other criteria. Currently, 84 WIC agencies provide services monthly to approximately one million participants at several hundred sites in local communities throughout the State.

76,"California Women, Infants and Children Program Redemption by County","The Women, Infants and Children (WIC) Program is a federally-funded health and nutrition program that provides assistance to pregnant women, new mothers, infants and children under age five. WIC helps California families by providing food benefits to individual participants based on their nutritional need and risk assessment. The food benefits can be used to purchase healthy supplemental foods from about 4,000 WIC authorized vendor stores throughout the State. WIC also provides nutritional education, breastfeeding support, healthcare referrals and other community services. Participants must meet income guidelines and other criteria. Currently, 84 WIC agencies provide services monthly to approximately one million participants at over 500 sites in local communities throughout the State.

Prior to June 2019, WIC issued paper food instruments (FIs) to individual participants for purchasing supplemental, nutritious foods. Beginning in June 2019, California WIC began transitioning to a new food delivery system, replacing the FI delivery system with the Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) system. California WIC completed this transition in March 2020. With the previous FI delivery system, participants were issued three or four paper FIs per month listing the foods that could be redeemed at authorized vendor stores. In order to take full advantage of their benefits in the FI delivery system, participants had to purchase all of the foods listed on a FI in a single transaction or lose that benefit. In contrast, in the EBT system a family’s benefits are combined and uploaded to one EBT card. Participants can use this card to purchase WIC foods as needed through the benefit expiry date without having to purchase foods that they don’t need yet and without risking losing their benefits.

The data files provided contain monthly and annual redemption information from the FI delivery system and the EBT system by the county in which WIC participants redeemed their food benefits. Because FIs are issued and redeemed at the participant level, the FI redemption data are presented with aggregation at the participant level (e.g., participant category). However, because EBT redemptions only occur at the family level, EBT data can only be presented with aggregation at the family level. Therefore, we provide two types of aggregated data:

1.  WIC Redemption by Vendor County by Participant Category contains the number of FIs redeemed, the dollar amount of FIs redeemed, and the count of unique individual participants, from 2010 to 2018. This data is no longer available beyond 2018 due to transitioning from the FI delivery system to the EBT system.

2. WIC Redemption by Vendor County with Family Counts contains data from before and after the EBT transition period (i.e., 2010 – present), and provides the count of unique families instead of participants. It comprises three parts:
    
    - Part A contains only FI redemption data from 2010 to 2018; 
    - Part B contains both the FI redemption data and the EBT redemption data for the EBT transition period that occurred in 2019 and 2020; 
    - Part C contains only EBT redemption data for 2021 and forward.

The dollar amount of redemptions and the number of families redeeming benefits are expected to vary from month to month. Many of these monthly variations can be attributed to the number of days and holidays in a month. Additionally, in June 2021 the federal government approved a Cash Value Benefits (CVB) expansion, which resulted in a large increase in monthly EBT redemption amounts. The initial CVB expansion was implemented in California from June 2021 to September 2021 and provided $35 per month for all non-infant participants, increased from $9 - $11. The CVB expansion was subsequently extended several times.  Effective October 1, 2023, CVB was set at new inflation-adjusted amounts where pregnant and postpartum individuals receive $47 per month, breastfeeding individuals receive $52 per month, individuals breastfeeding more than one infant receive $78 per month, and children ages 1-5 received $26 per month.

Hospital types include acute care, critical access, long-term acute care, free-standing rehabilitation hospitals, as well as acute rehabilitation units that report data separately.

CLABSI data for each hospital include the number of infections observed (reported) and predicted (based on national baseline data), the number of central line-days, the Standardized Infection Ratio (SIR) and associated 95% confidence intervals, and statistical interpretation to show whether CLABSI incidence was the same (no different), better (lower), or worse (higher) than the national baseline. Central line insertion practices (CLIP) adherence percent for each hospital is calculated from data reported by all critical care locations (i.e., critical care areas, neonatal critical care, and one special care area, ""Oncology - Medical/Surgical Critical Care""). In 2021, the CLIP reporting requirement to CDPH via NHSN was discontinued.

CLABSI SIRs are influenced by clinical and infection control practices related to central line insertion and infection control maintenance practices, patient-based risk factors, and surveillance and reporting methods. Health and Safety Code section 1288.55(a)(2) requires general acute care hospitals to report to CDPH all cases of CLABSI identified in their facilities.

126,Chemicals in Cosmetics,"These data reflect information that has been reported to the California Safe Cosmetics Program (CSCP) in the California Department of Public Health (CDPH). The primary purpose of the CSCP is to collect information on hazardous and potentially hazardous ingredients in cosmetic products sold in California and to make this information available to the public.   

For all cosmetic products sold in California, the California Safe Cosmetics Act (“the Act”) requires the manufacturer, packer, and/or distributor named on the product label to provide to the CSCP a list of all cosmetic products that contain any ingredients known or suspected to cause cancer, birth defects, or other developmental or reproductive harm.     

To assist companies with reporting, CDPH has compiled a list of reportable ingredients based on lists and reports available from the authoritative scientific bodies cited in the Act to cause cancer or reproductive harm; it is meant to serve as guidance and is not all-inclusive. Companies with reportable ingredients in their products must submit information to the California Safe Cosmetics Program if the company:   

*	Has annual aggregate sales of cosmetic products of one million dollars or more, and 
*	Has sold cosmetic products in California on or after January 1, 2007.   

The data table consists of: label names of cosmetic/personal care products, company/manufacturer names, product brand names, product categories, Chemical Abstracts Service registry numbers (CAS#) of the reported chemical ingredients, names of reported chemical ingredients, the number of reported chemicals for each product, and dates of reporting, product discontinuation or reformulation if applicable.   

All products containing carcinogens or developmental or reproductive toxicants may not be included due to companies failing to report.

134,Clostridioides difficile infections (CDI) in California Hospitals,"California Health and Safety Code section 1288.55(a)(1) requires general acute care hospitals to report all cases of Clostridioides difficile infections (CDI) identified in their facilities to the California Department of Public Health (CDPH). CDI data are submitted by hospitals to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). 

CDPH downloads California hospital CDI data from NHSN and analyzes the data to describe prevention progress in an annual public report of healthcare-associated infections CDPH publishes annual CDI data reported by each California hospital in the datasets below. 

The following datasets include the number of CDI reported by each California hospital in the specified reporting year. Beginning in 2016 for each California hospital, the annual CDI dataset includes the number of CDI that were predicted to occur in each hospital based on its specific facility-level characteristics. The observed (reported) number of CDI are then compared to the predicted number of CDI in a ratio called the Standardized Infection Ratio or SIR. The SIR is a metric that summarizes an individual hospital’s CDI prevention progress compared with the national baseline and California state-specific prevention goals. 

Detailed information about the variables included in each dataset are described in the accompanying data dictionaries for the year of interest.

For more information about the SIR and NHSN’s statistical models that are used to calculate the predicted number of CDI for each hospital, please review “NHSN’s Guide to the SIR”: https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/ps-analysis-resources/index.html 

For general information about NHSN, surveillance definitions, and reporting requirements for CDI, please visit: https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/index.html

161,Death Profiles by County,"This dataset contains counts of deaths for California counties based on information entered on death certificates. Final counts are derived from static data and include out-of-state deaths to California residents, whereas provisional counts are derived from incomplete and dynamic data. Provisional counts are based on the records available when the data was retrieved and may not represent all deaths that occurred during the time period. Deaths involving injuries from external or environmental forces, such as accidents, homicide and suicide, often require additional investigation that tends to delay certification of the cause and manner of death. This can result in significant under-reporting of these deaths in provisional data.

The final data tables include both deaths that occurred in each California county regardless of the place of residence (by occurrence) and deaths to residents of each California county (by residence), whereas the provisional data table only includes deaths that occurred in each county regardless of the place of residence (by occurrence). The data are reported as totals, as well as stratified by age, gender, race-ethnicity, and death place type. Deaths due to all causes (ALL) and selected underlying cause of death categories are provided. See temporal coverage for more information on which combinations are available for which years.

179,Dual Medi-Cal Enrollment and Medicare Advantage Enrollment in the Medicare Population in California Counties,"This data set accompanies the Profile of the California Medicare Population chartbook, published by the Office of Medicare Innovation and Integration in February 2022, and available at (https://www.dhcs.ca.gov/services/Documents/OMII-Medicare-Databook-February-18-2022.pdf). The three data files in this data set were analyzed from federal administrative data (the Medicare Master Beneficiary Summary File) for beneficiary characteristics as of March 2021. These datasets include: Medicare enrollment, Medicare Advantage enrollment (and its converse fee-for-service Medicare enrollment), dual Medi-Cal eligibility and enrollment (and its converse Medicare-only enrollment), by county. Medicare Savings Program enrollees were considered Medicare-only and not dually enrolled in Medi-Cal. All Medicare Part C beneficiaries, including PACE, Cal MediConnect and Special Needs Plans, were considered to have Medicare Advantage.

DHCS partnered with The SCAN Foundation and ATI Advisory in 2021 and 2022 to develop a series of chartbooks that provide information about Medicare beneficiaries in California. This work is supported by a grant from The SCAN Foundation to advance a coordinated and easily navigated system of high-quality services for older adults that preserve dignity and independence.

184,Educational Attainment,"This table contains data on the percent of population age 25 and up with a four-year college degree or higher for California, its regions, counties, county subdivisions, cities, towns, and census tracts. Greater educational attainment has been associated with health-promoting behaviors including consumption of fruits and vegetables and other aspects of healthy eating, engaging in regular physical activity, and refraining from excessive consumption of alcohol and from smoking. Completion of formal education (e.g., high school) is a key pathway to employment and access to healthier and higher paying jobs that can provide food, housing, transportation, health insurance, and other basic necessities for a healthy life. Education is linked with social and psychological factors, including sense of control, social standing and social support. These factors can improve health through reducing stress, influencing health-related behaviors and providing practical and emotional support.  More information on the data table and a data dictionary can be found in the Data and Resources section.  The educational attainment table is part of a series of indicators in the Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project (HCI) of the Office of Health Equity. The goal of HCI is to enhance public health by providing data, a standardized set of statistical measures, and tools that a broad array of sectors can use for planning healthy communities and evaluating the impact of plans, projects, policy, and environmental changes on community health. The creation of healthy social, economic, and physical environments that promote healthy behaviors and healthy outcomes requires coordination and collaboration across multiple sectors, including transportation, housing, education, agriculture and others. Statistical metrics, or indicators, are needed to help local, regional, and state public health and partner agencies assess community environments and plan for healthy communities that optimize public health. More information on HCI can be found here: https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OHE/CDPH%20Document%20Library/Accessible%202%20CDPH_Healthy_Community_Indicators1pager5-16-12.pdf  

The format of the educational attainment table is based on the standardized data format for all HCI indicators. As a result, this data table contains certain variables used in the HCI project (e.g., indicator ID, and indicator definition). Some of these variables may contain the same value for all observations.

217,Food Affordability,"This table contains data on the average cost of a market basket of nutritious food items relative to income for female-headed households with children, for California, its regions, counties, and cities/towns.  The ratio uses data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Census Bureau. The table is part of a series of indicators in the Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project of the Office of Health Equity. 
An adequate, nutritious diet is a necessity at all stages of life. Inadequate diets can impair intellectual performance and have been linked to more frequent school absence and poorer educational achievement in children. Nutrition also plays a significant role in causing or preventing a number of illnesses, such as cardiovascular disease, some cancers, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and anemia.
At least two factors influence the affordability of food and the dietary choices of families – the cost of food and family income. The inability to afford food is a major factor in food insecurity, which has a spectrum of effects including anxiety over food sufficiency or food shortages; reduced quality or desirability of diet; and disrupted eating patterns and reduced food intake.

Hospitals must report HCP influenza vaccination data to the California Department of Public Health (CDPH), including the percentage of HCP vaccinated. CDPH is required to make this information public on an annual basis [Health and Safety Code section 1288.8 (b)].

California acute care hospitals are required to offer free influenza vaccine to HCP. Hospital HCP must receive an annual vaccine or sign a declination form. Hospitals collect vaccination data for all HCP physically working in the hospital for at least one day during influenza season, regardless of clinical responsibility or patient contact. Hospitals report HCP vaccination rates to the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) and CDPH publishes the hospital results annually. CDPH reports data separately for hospital employees, licensed independent practitioners such as physicians, other contract staff, and trainees and volunteers (Health and Safety Code section 1288.7-1288.8).

Detailed information about the variables included in each dataset are described in the accompanying data dictionaries for the year of interest.

The California Department of Public Health (CDPH), Center for Health Care Quality, Licensing and Certification (L&C) Program licenses more than 30 types of healthcare facilities. The Electronic Licensing Management System (ELMS) is a CDPH data system created to manage state licensing-related data and enforcement actions. 

The “Health Facilities’ State Enforcement Actions” dataset includes summary information for state enforcement actions (state citations or administrative penalties) issued to California healthcare facilities. This file, a sub-set of the ELMS system data, includes state enforcement actions that have been issued from July 1, 1997 through June 30, 2024.  Data are presented for each citation/penalty, and include information about the type of enforcement action, violation category, penalty amount, violation date, appeal status, and facility. 

The “LTC Citation Narrative” dataset contains the full text of citations that were issued to long-term care (LTC) facilities between January 1, 2012 – December 31, 2017.  DO NOT DOWNLOAD in Excel as this file has large blocks of text which may truncate.  For example, Excel 2007 and later display, and allow up to, 32,767 characters in each cell, whereas earlier versions of Excel allow 32,767 characters, but only display the first 1,024 characters.  Please refer to instructions in “E_Citation_Access_DB_How_To_Docs”, about how to download and view data.  

These files enable providers and the public to identify facility non-compliance and quality issues. By making this information available, quality issues can be identified and addressed.  Please refer to the background paper, “About Health Facilities’ State Enforcement Actions” for information regarding California state enforcement actions before using these data.  Data dictionaries and data summary charts are also available.

Housing costs—typically the largest, single expense in a family's budget—also impact decisions that affect health. As housing consumes larger proportions of household income, families have less income for nutrition, health care, transportation, education, etc.  Severe cost burdens may induce poverty—which is associated with developmental and behavioral problems in children and accelerated cognitive and physical decline in adults.  Low-income families and minority communities are disproportionately affected by the lack of affordable, quality housing.

272,Income Inequality,"This table contains data on income inequality.  The primary measure is the Gini index – a measure of the extent to which the distribution of income among families/households within a community deviates from a perfectly equal distribution.  The index ranges from 0.0, when all families (households) have equal shares of income (implies perfect equality), to 1.0 when one family (household) has all the income and the rest have none (implies perfect inequality).  Index data is provided for California and its counties, regions, and large cities/towns. The data is from the U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey. The table is part of a series of indicators in the Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project of the Office of Health Equity. Income is linked to acquiring resources for healthy living. Both household income and the distribution of income across a society independently contribute to the overall health status of a community. On average Western industrialized nations with large disparities in income distribution tend to have poorer health status than similarly advanced nations with a more equitable distribution of income. Approximately 119,200 (5%) of the 2.4 million U.S. deaths in 2000 are attributable to income inequality. The pathways by which income inequality act to increase adverse health outcomes are not known with certainty, but policies that provide for a strong safety net of health and social services have been identified as potential buffers.

274,"Infant Mortality, Deaths Per 1,000 Live Births (LGHC Indicator)","This is a source dataset for a Let's Get Healthy California indicator at https://letsgethealthy.ca.gov/.
Infant Mortality is defined as the number of deaths in infants under one year of age per 1,000 live births. Infant mortality is often used as an indicator to measure the health and well-being of a community, because factors affecting the health of entire populations can also impact the mortality rate of infants. Although California’s infant mortality rate is better than the national average, there are significant disparities, with African American babies dying at more than twice the rate of other groups.
Data are from the Birth Cohort Files. The infant mortality indicator computed from the birth cohort file comprises birth certificate information on all births that occur in a calendar year (denominator) plus death certificate information linked to the birth certificate for those infants who were born in that year but subsequently died within 12 months of birth (numerator). Studies of infant mortality that are based on information from death certificates alone have been found to underestimate infant death rates for infants of all race/ethnic groups and especially for certain race/ethnic groups, due to problems such as confusion about event registration requirements, incomplete data, and transfers of newborns from one facility to another for medical care. 
Note there is a separate data table ""Infant Mortality by Race/Ethnicity"" which is based on death records only, which is more timely but less accurate than the Birth Cohort File.
Single year shown to provide state-level data and county totals for the most recent year. Numerator: Infants deaths (under age 1 year). Denominator: Live births occurring to California state residents. Multiple years aggregated to allow for stratification at the county level.
For this indicator, race/ethnicity is based on the birth certificate information, which records the race/ethnicity of the mother. The mother can “decline to state”; this is considered to be a valid response. These responses are not displayed on the indicator visualization.",California Department of Public Health,"California Department of Public Health, Center for Health Statistics and Informatics",opendata@cdph.ca.gov,None,2009-2016,State,other,English (EN),annually,Suppressed if less than 10 events,"","The Birth Cohort Files contain data for all live births that occurred in a calendar year, death information for those infants who were born in that year but subsequently died within 12 months of birth, and all fetal deaths that also occurred during that calendar year.",Terms of Use,Limitations,"","Analysis by strata excludes records where that strata is unknown.

The Immunization Branch at the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) collects, compiles and analyzes information on influenza activity year-round in California and produces a weekly influenza surveillance report during October through May. The California influenza surveillance system is a collaborative effort between CDPH and its many partners at local health departments, public health and clinical laboratories, vital statistics offices, healthcare providers, clinics, emergency departments, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). California data are also included in the CDC weekly influenza surveillance report, FluView, and help contribute to the national picture of Influenza activity in the United States. The information collected allows CDPH and CDC to: 1) find out when and where influenza activity is occurring; 2) track influenza-related illness; 3) determine what influenza viruses are circulating; 4) detect changes in influenza viruses; and 5) measure the impact influenza is having on hospitalizations and deaths.

308,Long-Term Services and Supports Measures and Dashboard Data,"The Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) Long-Term Services and Supports (LTSS) Data Dashboard is an initiative of the [Home and Community Based Services Spending Plan](https://www.dhcs.ca.gov/provgovpart/Pages/HCBS.aspx). The initiative's primary goal is to create a public-facing LTSS data dashboard to track demographic, utilization, quality, and cost data related to LTSS services. This dashboard will link statewide long-term care and home and community-based services (HCBS) data with the goal of increased transparency to make it possible for regulators, policymakers, and the public to be informed while the state continues to expand, enhance, and improve the quality of LTSS in all home, community, and congregate settings.

The first iteration of the LTSS Dashboard was released in December 2022 as an Open Data Portal file with 40 measures pertaining to LTSS beneficiaries, which includes ten different demographics, plan-related dimensions, and dual stratification. The December 2023 Data Release includes 16 new measures on the Medi-Cal LTSS Dashboard and Open Data Portal (Select “View Underlying Data”); and additional measures and dimensions, including dual stratification, will be added to the Open Data Portal in 2024.

Note: The LTSS Dashboard measures are based on certified eligible beneficiaries who were enrolled in Medi-Cal for one or more months during the reporting interval. Most of the DHCS LTSS dashboard measures report the annual number of certified eligible Medi-Cal beneficiaries who have used LTSS services within a year. Other departments may report on these programs differently. For example, the Department of Social Services (CDSS) reports monthly [IHSS recipient/consumer](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/ihss/program-data) counts. The California Department of Aging (CDA) reports monthly [CBAS Medi-Cal participants](https://aging.ca.gov/Providers_and_Partners/Community-Based_Adult_Services/Center_Overview/). DHCS’ annual utilization / enrollment counts of IHSS and CBAS beneficiaries are larger than CDSS/CDA's monthly counts because of data source differences and new enrollment or program attrition over time. Monthly snap-shot measures (average monthly utilization) for IHSS and CBAS have been added to the LTSS Dashboard to align with CDSS and CDA monthly reporting.

Refer to the [LTSS-Dashboard (ca.gov)](https://www.dhcs.ca.gov/services/Pages/LTSS-Dashboard.aspx) program page for: 
1) a Fact Sheet with highlights from the initial data release including changes over time in use of Home and Community-Based Services as well as select demographic information; 
2) the Measure Specifications document – that describes business rules and inclusion/exclusion criteria related to age groups, plan types, aid code, geographic, or other important program/waiver-specific eligibility criteria; and

Their pregnancies may be marked not only by substance use, but by lack of self-care, poor nutrition, smoking, homelessness, and stress that may affect their pregnancy and their children. Because these factors have not been controlled for, readers should not attempt to compare health delivery systems to one another based solely on the statistics presented in this dataset. Many factors influence the likelihood of receiving a comorbidity diagnosis prior to or at the time of delivery, including insurance status, language barriers, and continuity of care. These factors may result in the underreporting of chronic conditions, especially in vulnerable populations. When comparing Medi-Cal populations, readers should be aware of subpopulation size. Although some Medi-Cal subpopulations may disclose a high percentage of adverse birth outcomes, they only constitute a small fraction of Medi-Cal’s total births. Readers should interpret the greater occurrence of negative health outcomes in these small groups in light of their population size. A necessary step in comparing outcomes among health systems is risk adjustment. Risk adjustment is a method used to remove or reduce the effects of confounding factors in studies in which cases are not randomly assigned to different treatments, or in this case, systems of care. Multivariable adjustment is outside the scope of this type of statistical report.

339,Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bloodstream infections (BSI) in California Hospitals,"California Health and Safety Code section 1288.55(a)(1) requires general acute care hospitals to report all cases of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bloodstream infections (BSI) identified in their facilities to the California Department of Public Health (CDPH). MRSA BSI data are submitted by hospitals to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). 

CDPH downloads California hospital MRSA BSI data from NHSN and analyzes the data to describe prevention progress in an annual public report of healthcare-associated infections. CDPH publishes annual MRSA BSI data reported by each California hospital in the datasets below. 

The following datasets include the number of MRSA BSI reported by each California hospital in the specified reporting year. Beginning in 2016 for each California hospital, the annual MRSA BSI dataset includes the number of MRSA BSI that were predicted to occur in each hospital based on its specific facility-level characteristics. The observed (reported) number of MRSA BSI are then compared to the predicted number of MRSA BSI in a ratio called the Standardized Infection Ratio or SIR. The SIR is a metric that summarizes an individual hospital’s MRSA BSI prevention progress compared with the national baseline and California state-specific prevention goals. 

The datasets also include the associated 95% confidence intervals for the SIR and statistical interpretation to show whether MRSA BSI incidence was the same (no different), better (lower) or worse (higher) than the national baseline. Another performance measure in this dataset allows for tracking hospital progress in meeting national HAI reduction goals. Hospitals must have an SIR at or below incremental targets each year to be considered on track.

Detailed information about the variables included in each dataset are described in the accompanying data dictionaries for the year of interest.

For more information about the SIR and NHSN’s statistical models that are used to calculate the predicted number of MRSA BSI for each hospital, please review “NHSN’s Guide to the SIR”: https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/ps-analysis-resources/index.html

340,Modified Retail Food Environment Index,"This table contains data on the modified retail food environment index for California, its regions, counties, cities, towns, and census tracts.   An adequate, nutritious diet is a necessity at all stages of life. Pregnant women and their developing babies, children, adolescents, adults, and older adults depend on adequate nutrition for optimum development and maintenance of health and functioning. Nutrition also plays a significant role in causing or preventing a number of illnesses, such as cardiovascular disease, some cancers, obesity, type-2 diabetes, and anemia. Peoples’ food choices and their likelihood of being overweight or obese are also influenced by their food environment: the foods available in their neighborhoods including stores, restaurants, schools, and worksites.  

The modified retail food environment index table is part of a series of indicators in the Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project (HCI) of the Office of Health Equity. The goal of HCI is to enhance public health by providing data, a standardized set of statistical measures, and tools that a broad array of sectors can use for planning healthy communities and evaluating the impact of plans, projects, policy, and environmental changes on community health. The creation of healthy social, economic, and physical environments that promote healthy behaviors and healthy outcomes requires coordination and collaboration across multiple sectors, including transportation, housing, education, agriculture and others. Statistical metrics, or indicators, are needed to help local, regional, and state public health and partner agencies assess community environments and plan for healthy communities that optimize public health. More information on HCI can be found here: https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OHE/CDPH%20Document%20Library/Accessible%202%20CDPH_Healthy_Community_Indicators1pager5-16-12.pdf  

The format of the modified retail food environment table is based on the standardized data format for all HCI indicators. As a result, this data table contains certain variables used in the HCI project (e.g., indicator ID, and indicator definition). Some of these variables may contain the same value for all observations.

347,Newborn Screening Disorders,"This dataset contains three tables of aggregated (2009-2019) data on newborn screening disorders: 1) counts statewide , 2) counts by race/ethnicity, 3) counts by California region.  The tables present counts of disorders that have been diagnosed by the California Newborn Screening Program. Counts were suppressed for disorders with fewer than 6 cases, as described in the individual table descriptions.

The disorders are included on the core Recommended Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP) put forth by the Secretary’s Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children (SACHDNC) established under Section 1111 of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act, 42 U.S.C. 300b-10, as amended in the Newborn Screening Saves Lives Act of 2008. The SACHDNC recommends that every state newborn screening program include a uniform screening panel that currently includes 33 core disorders. The Newborn Screening Program screens for all of the core conditions except Spinal Muscular Atrophy, which began in June 2020. Newborn hearing loss screening and critical congenital heart disease screening are programs administered by the California Department of Health Care Services. Details of the disorders included on the RUSP can be found in the attachment: Recommended Uniform Screening Panel.pdf.

Caution must be taken in interpreting these data because there is not a one-to-one relationship between a screen-positive test result and a disorder. A newborn can be screen-positive for more than one disorder. Conversely, a positive screen for one disorder can be associated with the diagnosis of a different disorder. Four types of sickle cell-related hemoglobinopathies (Sickle Beta0 Thalassemia, Sickle Beta+ Thalassemia, Sickle S/S Disease, and Sickle S/C Disease) were combined into one group called ""Sickle Cell Disease.""

359,"Number of licensed day care center slots per 1,000 children aged 0-5 years","This table contains data on the number of licensed day care center slots (facility capacity) per 1,000 children aged 0-5 years in California, its regions, counties, cities, towns, and census tracts. The table contains 2015 data, and includes type of facility (day care center or infant center). Access to child care has become a critical support for working families. Many working families find high-quality child care unaffordable, and the increasing cost of child care can be crippling for low-income families and single parents. These barriers can impact parental choices of child care. Increased availability of child care facilities can positively impact families by providing more choices of child care in terms of price and quality. Estimates for this indicator are provided for the total population, and are not available by race/ethnicity. More information on the data table and a data dictionary can be found in the Data and Resources section.
The licensed day care centers table is part of a series of indicators in the Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project (HCI) of the Office of Health Equity. The goal of HCI is to enhance public health by providing data, a standardized set of statistical measures, and tools that a broad array of sectors can use for planning healthy communities and evaluating the impact of plans, projects, policy, and environmental changes on community health. The creation of healthy social, economic, and physical environments that promote healthy behaviors and healthy outcomes requires coordination and collaboration across multiple sectors, including transportation, housing, education, agriculture and others. Statistical metrics, or indicators, are needed to help local, regional, and state public health and partner agencies assess community environments and plan for healthy communities that optimize public health.

These surveys have been discontinued.  Adults, adolescents, and children (with parental assistance) were asked for their current height and weight, from which, body mass index (BMI) was calculated. For adults, a BMI of 30.0 and above is considered obese. For adolescents and children, obesity is defined as having a BMI at or above the 95th percentile, according to CDC growth charts.

The California Dietary Practices Surveys (CDPS), the California Teen Eating, Exercise and Nutrition Survey (CalTEENS), and the California Children’s Healthy Eating and Exercise Practices Surveys (CalCHEEPS) (now discontinued) were the most extensive dietary and physical activity assessments of adults 18 years and older, adolescents 12 to 17, and children 6 to 11, respectively, in the state of California. CDPS and CalCHEEPS were administered biennially in odd years up through 2013 and CalTEENS was administered biennially in even years through 2014.  The surveys were designed to monitor dietary trends, especially fruit and vegetable consumption, among Californias for evaluating their progress toward meeting the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the Healthy People 2020 Objectives. All three surveys were conducted via telephone. Adult and adolescent data were collected using a list of participating CalFresh households and random digit dial, and child data were collected using only the list of CalFresh households. Older children (9-11) were the primary respondents with some parental assistance. For younger children (6-8), the primary respondent was parents. Data were oversampled for low-income and African American to provide greater sensitivity for analyzing trends among the target population. Wording of the question used for these analyses varied by survey (age group). The questions were worded are as follows:  Adult:1) How tall are you without shoes?2) How much do you weigh?Adolescent:1) About how much do you weigh without shoes?2) About how tall are you without shoes?

Residential crowding reflects demographic and socioeconomic conditions.  Older-adult immigrant and recent immigrant communities, families with low income and renter-occupied households are more likely to experience household crowding.  A form of residential overcrowding known as ""doubling up""—co-residence with family members or friends for economic reasons—is the most commonly reported prior living situation for families and individuals before the onset of homelessness.

This threshold applies to prescription drug products with a WAC greater than $40 for a course of therapy. Required WAC increase reports are to be submitted to HCAI within a month after the end of the quarter in which the WAC increase went into effect. Please see the statute and regulations for additional information regarding reporting thresholds and report due dates.

Key data elements in this dataset include the National Drug Code (NDC) maintained by the FDA, narrative descriptions of the reasons for the increase in WAC, and the five-year history of WAC increases for the NDC. A WAC Increase Report consists of 27 data elements that have been divided into two separate Excel data sets: Prescription Drug WAC Increase and Prescription Drug WAC Increase – 5 Year History. The datasets include manufacturer WAC Increase Reports received since January 1, 2019. The Prescription Drugs WAC Increase dataset consists of the information submitted by prescription drug manufacturers that pertains to the current WAC increase of a given report, including the amount of the current increase, the WAC after increase, and the effective date of the increase. The Prescription Drugs WAC Increase – 5 Year History dataset consists of the information submitted by prescription drug manufacturers for the data elements that comprise the 5-year history of WAC increases of a given report, including the amount of each increase and their effective dates.

There are 2 types of WAC Increase datasets below: Monthly and Annual. The Monthly datasets include the data in completed reports submitted by manufacturers for calendar year 2025, as of September 9, 2025. The Annual datasets include data in completed reports submitted by manufacturers for the specified year. The datasets may include reports that do not meet the specified minimum thresholds for reporting.

Preterm births are all live births less than 37 weeks of gestation. Very preterm births are all live births less than 32 weeks of gestation. Important growth and development occur throughout pregnancy, especially in the final months and weeks. There is a higher risk of serious disability or death the earlier a baby is born. Gestational age is based on obstetric estimate at delivery (OE). Data includes births with gestational age of 17-47 weeks.  Note: The race and ethnic groups in this table utilize eight mutually exclusive race and ethnicity categories. These categories are Hispanic and the following Non-Hispanic categories of Multi-Race, African-American, American Indian (includes Eskimo and Aleut), Asian, Pacific Islander (includes Hawaiian), White (includes Other race) and Unknown (includes refused to state and missing).                                                                                                 

Data should not be compared to other data where gestational age is based on the date of last normal menses (LMP) and not OE. The National Center for Health Statistics recently transitioned to using an OE-based gestational age measure due to increasing evidence  of its greater validity compared with the LMP-based measure.

Adult smoking prevalence in California, males and females aged 18+, starting in 2012. Caution must be used when comparing the percentages of smokers over time as the definition of ‘current smoker’ was broadened in 1996, and the survey methods were changed in 2012. Current cigarette smoking is defined as having smoked at least 100 cigarettes in lifetime and now smoking every day or some days. Due to the methodology change in 2012, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend not conducting analyses where estimates from 1984 – 2011 are compared with analyses using the new methodology, beginning in 2012. This includes analyses examining trends and changes over time. (For more information, please see the narrative description.)
The California Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is an on-going telephone survey of randomly selected adults, which collects information on a wide variety of health-related behaviors and preventive health practices related to the leading causes of death and disability such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes and injuries. Data are collected monthly from a random sample of the California population aged 18 years and older. The BRFSS is conducted by Public Health Survey Research Program of California State University, Sacramento under contract from CDPH. The survey has been conducted since 1984 by the California Department of Public Health in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In 2012, the survey methodology of the California BRFSS changed significantly so that the survey would be more representative of the general population. Several changes were implemented: 1) the survey became dual-frame, with both cell and landline random-digit dial components, 2) residents of college housing were eligible to complete the BRFSS, and 3) raking or iterative proportional fitting was used to calculate the survey weights. Due to these changes, estimates from 1984 – 2011 are not comparable to estimates from 2012 and beyond. Center for Disease Control and Policy (CDC) and recommend not conducting analyses where estimates from 1984 – 2011 are compared with analyses using the new methodology, beginning in 2012.

In statistics, a confidence interval is a measure of the reliability of an estimate. It is a type of interval estimate of a population parameter. The CSTS is a large-scale biennial survey, in-school student survey administered to middle (grades 8) and high school (grades 10 and 12) students.

409,Provider Suspended and Ineligible List (S&I List),"Medi-Cal law, _Welfare and Institutions Code_ (W&I Code), sections 14043.6 and 14123, mandate that the Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) suspend a Medi-Cal provider of health care services (provider) from participation in the Medi-Cal program when the individual or entity has:

* Been convicted of a felony;
* Been convicted of a misdemeanor involving fraud, abuse of the Medi-Cal program or any patient, or otherwise substantially related to the qualifications, functions, or duties of a provider of service;
* Been suspended from the federal Medicare or Medicaid programs for any reason;
* Lost or surrendered a license, certificate, or approval to provide health care; or
* Breached a contractual agreement with the Department that explicitly specifies inclusion on this list as a consequence of the breach.

__Suspension of Entities Submitting Claims for Suspended Providers__

Suspension is automatic when any of the above events occurs, and suspended Medi-Cal providers will not be entitled to a hearing under the _California Administrative Procedures Act_.

Services rendered, prescribed or ordered by a suspended Medi-Cal provider shall not be covered by the Medi-Cal program while the suspension is in effect. _California Code of Regulations_, title 22, section 51303, subdivision (k), provides that at least fifteen (15) days written notice be given to all affected providers. This list constitutes such written notice. Although the period of suspension may have expired, reinstatement rights are not automatic. The provider must petition for reinstatement and re-enroll with DHCS before being reimbursed for services rendered. Providers suspended as a result of a Medicare action must appeal through the Medicare office before applying for re-enrollment with Medi-Cal.

In accordance with W&I Code, section 14043.61, subdivision (a), a provider of health care services shall be subject to suspension if claims for payment are submitted under any provider number used by the provider to obtain reimbursement from the Medi-Cal program for the services, goods, supplies or merchandise provided, directly or indirectly to a Medi-Cal beneficiary, by an individual or entity that is suspended, excluded or otherwise ineligible because of a sanction to receive, directly or indirectly, reimbursement from the Medi-Cal program and the individual or entity is listed on either the _Medi-Cal Suspended and Ineligible Provider List_ (S&I List) published by DHCS to identify suspended and otherwise ineligible providers, or any list published by the federal Office of Inspector General regarding the suspension or exclusion of individuals or entities from the federal Medicare and Medicaid programs, to identify suspended, excluded or otherwise ineligible providers.

Examples of providers who need to be aware of the provisions of this law, and could be suspended if violating the law are:

1. Billing services that submit claims for Medi-Cal providers who are suspended;
2. Pharmacies that fill prescriptions and bill for services prescribed by a suspended provider;
3. Providers who bill for services under referral or prescription of a provider who is suspended;
4. Providers who employ and submit claims for the services of an individual who is a suspended provider;
5. Physician groups, clinics and institutions that employ and submit claims for the services of an individual who is a suspended provider;
6. Any individuals or entities that enter into a business arrangement and submit claims for or in conjunction with an individual or entity that is suspended.

Always refer to the S&I List when verifying ineligibility. Eligibility or ineligibility must also be verified through the Health and Human Services (HHS) Federal Office of Inspector General (OIG) [List of Excluded Individuals/Entities](https://oig.hhs.gov/exclusions/exclusions_list.asp). Cross-referencing both lists is recommended to help identify providers who have already been suspended or sanctioned. The S&I List is not all inclusive.

431,Respondents Indicating At Least 1 Type of Adverse Childhood Experience (LGHC Indicator),"This is a source dataset for a Let's Get Healthy California indicator at https://letsgethealthy.ca.gov/. The Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) module of the Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System (BRFSS) asks respondents questions about eight different traumatic childhood experiences that occurred before the age of 18. These include verbal/emotional abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse, and negative household situations including the incarceration of an adult, alcohol or drug abuse by an adult, violence between adults, mental illness of a household member, and parental divorce or separation. A cumulative ACEs score is calculated for each respondent by counting the number of these items that a respondent reported experiencing, creating a score ranging from 0 to 8.
11 questions about adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are condensed into a ordinal scale from 0 to 8 possible ACEs. This indicator shows the prevalence of adults who reported having 1 or more ACEs. However other data cuts are available, e.g., 3 or more ACEs The ACEs module is a very ""lagging"" indicator capturing childhood experiences retrospectively by asking adults 18+ years of age.  Additional limitations include: 1) relies on self-reported information, 2) provides prevalence, not incidence data, 3) bias or measurement error associated with telephone-administered survey of a sample of the population (e.g., response bias, sampling variation), 4) designed to provide state-level population health estimates and does not provide sub-state estimates or estimates by racial sub-groups (e.g., Asian sub-groups) unless multiple years are combined. Because of the changes in the methodology, researchers are advised to avoid comparing data collected before the changes (up to 2010) with data collected from 2011 and onward: http://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/2013/pdf/compare_2013.pdf.

432,Retail Availability of Electronic Smoking Devices by County,"This data table shows the percentage of tobacco retailer stores that sell electronic smoking devices (including e-cigarettes, other vapor devices or e-liquids) in 2013 and 2016 by county. Data for three city health departments (Berkeley, Long Beach and Pasadena) were analyzed separately, results for Alameda County include the city of Berkeley and results for Los Angeles County include the cities of Pasadena and Long Beach. Results were suppressed for items with a small sample size (n =< 5) and for results considered unreliable (coefficient of variation greater than or equal to 0.5). Cities or counties that conducted a census of tobacco retailers will not have a confidence interval due to the survey methodology.

The Healthy Stores for a Healthy Community (HSHC) marketing survey measured the availability of a range of unhealthy and healthy products, as well as marketing practices for tobacco, alcohol, food and beverage items, and condoms. The California Tobacco Control Program (CTCP) invited partners in the Nutrition Education and Obesity Prevention Branch at the California Department of Public Health (CDPH), the Substance Use Disorders Program at the California Department of Health Care Services (DHCS), and the Sexually Transmitted Diseases Control Branch at CDPH to join the campaign and look at the retail environment from a more comprehensive perspective, as there were many local and state efforts examining one or more of these health issues in community stores. This collaboration is part of the state’s continued effort to address the burden of chronic disease and to better understand the role that stores could play in making communities healthier. In 2013, the 61 local lead agencies (LLAs) completed the HSHC survey in a total of 7,393 randomly selected stores that sell tobacco throughout the state of California. In 2016, the LLAs completed a follow-up survey in 7,152 randomly selected stores that sell tobacco statewide.

All general acute care hospital buildings are assigned a Structural Performance Category (SPC) which measures the probable seismic performance of building structural systems. Building structural systems include beams, columns, shear walls, slabs, and foundations. SPC ratings range from 1 to 5 with SPC 1 assigned to buildings that may be at risk of collapse during a strong earthquake and SPC 5 assigned to buildings reasonably capable of providing services to the public following a strong earthquake. State law requires all SPC 1 buildings to be removed from providing general acute care services by January 1, 2020, unless an approved extension has been granted, and all SPC 2 buildings to be removed from providing general acute care services by January 1, 2030. A hospital facility meets the January 1, 2030 requirements if all the general acute care buildings on campus are SPC and NPC compliant. 2030 compliant SPC ratings are either SPC 3, 4, 4D, or 5. 2030 compliant NPC ratings is NPC 5.

Preventable hospitalizations rates were created by dividing the number of patients who are 18 years and older and were admitted to a hospital for at least one of the preventable hospitalization diagnoses (see list below) by the total number of hospitalizations. List of preventable hospitalization diagnoses: diabetes with short-term complications, diabetes with long-term complications, uncontrolled diabetes without complications, diabetes with lower-extremity amputation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, hypertension, heart failure, angina without a cardiac procedure, dehydration, bacterial pneumonia, or urinary tract infection were counted as a preventable hospitalization.

447,Statewide Death Profiles,"This dataset contains counts of deaths for California as a whole based on information entered on death certificates. Final counts are derived from static data and include out-of-state deaths to California residents, whereas provisional counts are derived from incomplete and dynamic data. Provisional counts are based on the records available when the data was retrieved and may not represent all deaths that occurred during the time period. Deaths involving injuries from external or environmental forces, such as accidents, homicide and suicide, often require additional investigation that tends to delay certification of the cause and manner of death. This can result in significant under-reporting of these deaths in provisional data.

The final data tables include both deaths that occurred in California regardless of the place of residence (by occurrence) and deaths to California residents (by residence), whereas the provisional data table only includes deaths that occurred in California regardless of the place of residence (by occurrence). The data are reported as totals, as well as stratified by age, gender, race-ethnicity, and death place type. Deaths due to all causes (ALL) and selected underlying cause of death categories are provided. See temporal coverage for more information on which combinations are available for which years.

The cause of death categories are based solely on the underlying cause of death as coded by the International Classification of Diseases. The underlying cause of death is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as ""the disease or injury which initiated the train of events leading directly to death, or the circumstances of the accident or violence which produced the fatal injury."" It is a single value assigned to each death based on the details as entered on the death certificate.

California hospitals track and report deep incisional and organ/space SSIs for adults and pediatric patients for 28 types of operative procedures: 

abdominal aortic aneurysm repair; abdominal hysterectomy; appendix surgery; bile duct, liver or pancreatic surgery, cardiac surgery; Cesarean section; colon surgery; coronary artery bypass graft with both chest and donor site incisions; coronary artery bypass graft with chest incision only*; exploratory abdominal surgery (laparotomy); gallbladder surgery; gastric surgery; heart transplant; hip prosthesis; kidney surgery; kidney transplant; knee prosthesis; laminectomy; liver transplant; open reduction of fracture; ovarian surgery; pacemaker surgery; rectal surgery; small bowel surgery; spinal fusion; spleen surgery; thoracic surgery; vaginal hysterectomy.

The SSI data tables include information on the statewide and hospital-specific SSI incidence by operative procedure types, displaying procedure counts, number of infections observed (reported) and predicted, the standardized infection ratio (SIR) and associated 95% confidence intervals, as well as statistical interpretation to show whether SSI incidence was the same (no different), better (lower), or worse (higher) than the national baseline. Another performance measure in this dataset allows for tracking hospital progress in meeting established HAI reduction goals. Hospitals must have an SIR at or below incremental targets each year to be considered on track. California hospitals should achieve 30% reductions in SSI incidence from 2015 to 2020.

NHSN calculates the predicted number of infections using procedure-specific risk adjustment logistic regression models based on 2015 national baseline data and that accounts for particular patient-level factors and hospital characteristics found to be significant predictors of SSI incidence. The number of predicted infections generated from these models is used to calculate the SIR, a measure of HAI incidence, by dividing the number of actual observed infections by the number of predicted infections.

Detailed information about the variables included in each dataset are described in the accompanying data dictionaries for the year of interest. For more information about the SIR and NHSN’s statistical models, please review the “NHSN Guide to the SIR” at https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/ps-analysis-resources/index.html

The MDCs are also generally associated with a particular medical specialty. Therefore, the MDCs can be used to help identify what types of health care specialists are needed at each facility. For instance, a facility with “Circulatory System, Disease and Disorders” as one of their Top Five MDC diagnosis groups is more likely to have a greater need for cardiac specialists. The data will be updated on an annual basis.

The table is part of a series of indicators in the Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project of the Office of Health Equity. Unemployment is associated with higher rates of self-reported poor health, long-term illnesses, higher incidence of risky health behaviors (alcoholism, smoking), and increased mortality. Various explanations have been proposed for the link between poor health and unemployment; for example, economic deprivation that results in reduced access to essential goods and services.  Another explanation is that unemployment causes the loss of latent functions (social contact, social status, time structure and personal identity) which can result in stigma, isolation and loss of self-worth.

465,Vaccine Preventable Disease Cases by County and Year,"These data contain counts of vaccine preventable disease cases among California residents by county, disease, and year.

The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) maintains a mandatory, passive reporting system for a list1 of communicable disease cases and outbreaks. The CDPH Immunization Branch conducts surveillance for vaccine preventable diseases. Health care providers and laboratories are mandated to report cases or suspected cases of these communicable diseases to their local health department (LHD). LHDs are also mandated to report these cases to CDPH. 

## Materials and Methods 

### Case data sources and inclusion criteria 

Data were extracted on communicable disease cases with an estimated onset or diagnosis date from 2001 through the last year indicated, from California Confidential Morbidity Reports and/or Laboratory Reports that were submitted to CDPH and which met the surveillance case definition for that disease.2 Because of inherent delays in case reporting and depending on the length of follow-up of clinical, laboratory and epidemiologic investigation, cases with eligible onset dates may be added or rescinded after the date of this report. 

### Definitions 

In general, we defined a case as laboratory and/or clinical evidence of infection or disease in a person that satisfied the communicable disease surveillance case definition published by the United States (US) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or by the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) at the time the case was reported. 

## Limitations 

### Completeness of reporting 

The numbers of disease cases in this report are likely to underestimate the true magnitude of disease. Among factors that may contribute to under-reporting are: delays in notification, limited collection or appropriate testing of specimens, health care seeking behavior among ill persons, limited resources and competing priorities in LHDs, and lack of reporting by clinicians and laboratories. Among factors that may contribute to changes in reporting are disease severity, the availability of new or less expensive diagnostic tests, changes in the case definition by CDC or CDPH, changes in mandatory reporting requirements, recent media or public attention, and active surveillance activities. Differential reporting practices among LHDs may also result in inconsistent reporting of patient information.

466,Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococci (VRE) Bloodstream Infections in California Hospitals,"California Health and Safety Code section 1288.55(a)(1) requires general acute care hospitals to report all cases of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) bloodstream infections (BSI) to the California Department of Public Health (CDPH). Hospitals report VRE data to CDPH via the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) following NHSN protocols and definitions. 

CDPH downloads California hospital VRE BSI data from NHSN and analyzes the data to describe prevention progress in an annual public report of healthcare-associated infections. CDPH publishes annual VRE BSI data in datasets that include the number of VRE BSI reported by each California hospital in the specified reporting year and the hospital-onset VRE BSI rate. The VRE BSI rate is calculated by dividing the number of cases by the total number of patient days; the rate is then reported per 10,000 patient days. VRE BSI rates are not risk adjusted because there are no such methods available at this time. Aggregate mean rates used for comparisons are stratified by hospital type (and for community hospitals, by bed size). The unadjusted VRE BSI rates herein are affected by the clinical services provided, infection control practices, and surveillance methods. 

Detailed information about the variables included in each dataset are described in the accompanying data dictionaries for the year of interest.

The table is part of a series of indicators in the [Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project of the Office of Health Equity.](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OHE/Pages/HCI-Search.aspx) Political participation can be associated with the health of a community through two possible mechanisms: through the implementation of social policies or as an indirect measure of social capital. Disparities in political participation across socioeconomic groups can influence political outcomes and the resulting policies could have an impact on the opportunities available to the poor to live a healthy life. Lower representation of poorer voters could result in reductions of social programs aimed toward supporting disadvantaged groups. Although there is no direct evidentiary connection between voter registration or participation and health, there is evidence that populations with higher levels of political participation also have greater social capital. Social capital is defined as resources accessed by individuals or groups through social networks that provide a mutual benefit. Several studies have shown a positive association between social capital and lower mortality rates, and higher self- assessed health ratings. There is also evidence of a cycle where lower levels of political participation are associated with poor self-reported health, and poor self-reported health hinders political participation.

480,Walkable Distance to Public Transit,"This table contains data on the percent of population residing within ½ mile of a major transit stop for four California regions and the counties, cities/towns, and census tracts within the regions.  The percent was calculated using data from four metropolitan planning organizations (San Diego Association of Governments, Southern California Association of Governments, Metropolitan Transportation Commission, and Sacramento Council of Governments) and the U.S. Census Bureau. The table is part of a series of indicators in the Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project of the Office of Health Equity.

562,Respiratory Virus Weekly Report,"__Data is from the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) Respiratory Virus Weekly Report.__

The report is updated each Friday.                                                                                   

__Laboratory surveillance data__: California laboratories report SARS-CoV-2 test results to CDPH through electronic laboratory reporting. Los Angeles County SARS-CoV-2 lab data has a 7-day reporting lag. Test positivity is calculated using SARS-CoV-2 lab tests that has a specimen collection date reported during a given week.  
 
Laboratory surveillance for influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and other respiratory viruses (parainfluenza types 1-4, human metapneumovirus, non-SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses, adenovirus, enterovirus/rhinovirus) involves the use of data from clinical sentinel laboratories (hospital, academic or private) located throughout California. Specimens for testing are collected from patients in healthcare settings and do not reflect all testing for influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and other respiratory viruses in California. These laboratories report the number of laboratory-confirmed influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and other respiratory virus detections and isolations, and the total number of specimens tested by virus type on a weekly basis.  
 
Test positivity for a given week is calculated by dividing the number of positive COVID-19, influenza, RSV, or other respiratory virus results by the total number of specimens tested for that virus. Weekly laboratory surveillance data are defined as Sunday through Saturday. 

__Hospitalization data__: Data on COVID-19 and influenza hospital admissions are from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) Hospitalization dataset. The requirement to report COVID-19 and influenza-associated hospitalizations was effective November 1, 2024. CDPH pulls NHSN data from the CDC on the Wednesday prior to the publication of the report. Results may differ depending on which day data are pulled. Admission rates are calculated using population estimates from the P-3: Complete State and County Projections Dataset provided by the State of California Department of Finance (https://dof.ca.gov/forecasting/demographics/projections/). Reported weekly admission rates for the entire season use the population estimates for the year the season started. For more information on NHSN data including the protocol and data collection information, see the CDC NHSN webpage (https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/index.html). 

CDPH collaborates with Northern California Kaiser Permanente (NCKP) to monitor trends in RSV admissions. The percentage of RSV admissions is calculated by dividing the number of RSV-related admissions by the total number of admissions during the same period. Admissions for pregnancy, labor and delivery, birth, and outpatient procedures are not included in total number of admissions. These admissions serve as a proxy for RSV activity and do not necessarily represent laboratory confirmed hospitalizations for RSV infections; NCKP members are not representative of all Californians.  

Weekly hospitalization data are defined as Sunday through Saturday. 

__Death certificate data__: CDPH receives weekly year-to-date dynamic data on deaths occurring in California from the CDPH Center for Health Statistics and Informatics. These data are limited to deaths occurring among California residents and are analyzed to identify influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and COVID-19-coded deaths. These deaths are not necessarily laboratory-confirmed and are an underestimate of all influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and COVID-19-associated deaths in California. Weekly death data are defined as Sunday through Saturday. 

__Wastewater data__: This dataset represents statewide weekly SARS-CoV-2 wastewater summary values. SARS-CoV-2 wastewater concentrations from all sites in California are combined into a single, statewide, unit-less summary value for each week, using a method for data transformation and aggregation developed by the CDC National Wastewater Surveillance System (NWSS). Please see the CDC NWSS data methods page for a description of how these summary values are calculated. Weekly wastewater data are defined as Sunday through Saturday. ",California Department of Public Health,Division of Communicable Disease Control,InfluenzaSurveillance@cdph.ca.gov,https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/RespiratoryVirusReport.aspx,2020 to present,Statewide,statewide,English,weekly,"","","",Terms of Use,Limitations,"","CDPH Influenza Homepage: https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/pages/immunization/influenza.aspx

For source tables refer to InfoUSA update procedural documentation. The 2010 MSSA Detail layer was developed to update fields affected by population change. The American Community Survey 5-year 2006-2010 population data pertaining to total, in households, race, ethnicity, age, and poverty was used in the update. The 2010 MSSA Census Tract Detail map layer was developed to support geographic information systems (GIS) applications, representing 2010 census tract geography that is the foundation of 2010 medical service study area (MSSA) boundaries. ***This version is the finalized MSSA reconfiguration boundaries based on the US Census Bureau 2010 Census. In 1976 Garamendi Rural Health Services Act, required the development of a geographic framework for determining which parts of the state were rural and which were urban, and for determining which parts of counties and cities had adequate health care resources and which were &quot;medically underserved&quot;. Thus, sub-city and sub-county geographic units called &quot;medical service study areas [MSSAs]&quot; were developed, using combinations of census-defined geographic units, established following General Rules promulgated by a statutory commission. After each subsequent census the MSSAs were revised. In the scheduled revisions that followed the 1990 census, community meetings of stakeholders (including county officials, and representatives of hospitals and community health centers) were held in larger metropolitan areas. The meetings were designed to develop consensus as how to draw the sub-city units so as to best display health care disparities. The importance of involving stakeholders was heightened in 1992 when the United States Department of Health and Human Services' Health and Resources Administration entered a formal agreement to recognize the state-determined MSSAs as &quot;rational service areas&quot; for federal recognition of &quot;health professional shortage areas&quot; and &quot;medically underserved areas&quot;. After the 2000 census, two innovations transformed the process, and set the stage for GIS to emerge as a major factor in health care resource planning in California. First, the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development [OSHPD], which organizes the community stakeholder meetings and provides the staff to administer the MSSAs, entered into an Enterprise GIS contract. Second, OSHPD authorized at least one community meeting to be held in each of the 58 counties, a significant number of which were wholly rural or frontier counties. For populous Los Angeles County, 11 community meetings were held. As a result, health resource data in California are collected and organized by 541 geographic units. The boundaries of these units were established by community healthcare experts, with the objective of maximizing their usefulness for needs assessment purposes. The most dramatic consequence was introducing a data simultaneously displayed in a GIS format. A two-person team, incorporating healthcare policy and GIS expertise, conducted the series of meetings, and supervised the development of the 2000-census configuration of the MSSAs.</font></div><div><font size='3'><br /></font></div><div><font size='3'><b>MSSA Configuration Guidelines (General Rules):</b>- Each MSSA is composed of one or more complete census tracts.- As a general rule, MSSAs are deemed to be &quot;rational service areas [RSAs]&quot; for purposes of designating health professional shortage areas [HPSAs], medically underserved areas [MUAs] or medically underserved populations [MUPs].- MSSAs will not cross county lines.- To the extent practicable, all census-defined places within the MSSA are within 30 minutes travel time to the largest population center within the MSSA, except in those circumstances where meeting this criterion would require splitting a census tract.- To the extent practicable, areas that, standing alone, would meet both the definition of an MSSA and a Rural MSSA, should not be a part of an Urban MSSA.- Any Urban MSSA whose population exceeds 200,000 shall be divided into two or more Urban MSSA Subdivisions.- Urban MSSA Subdivisions should be within a population range of 75,000 to 125,000, but may not be smaller than five square miles in area. If removing any census tract on the perimeter of the Urban MSSA Subdivision would cause the area to fall below five square miles in area, then the population of the Urban MSSA may exceed 125,000. - To the extent practicable, Urban MSSA Subdivisions should reflect recognized community and neighborhood boundaries and take into account such demographic information as income level and ethnicity. Rural Definitions: A rural MSSA is an MSSA adopted by the Commission, which has a population density of less than 250 persons per square mile, and which has no census defined place within the area with a population in excess of 50,000. Only the population that is located within the MSSA is counted in determining the population of the census defined place. A frontier MSSA is a rural MSSA adopted by the Commission which has a population density of less than 11 persons per square mile. Any MSSA which is not a rural or frontier MSSA is an urban MSSA.

1420,Healthcare Payments Data (HPD) Services Report,"This dataset contains data for the Healthcare Payments Data (HPD) Services report. The term ""Services"" refers to individual procedures reported on the service lines of healthcare claims in California, categorized using the Restructured Berenson-Eggers Type of Services (BETOS) Classification System (RBCS) from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). The data in the report includes three main metrics: Total services, the total member count, and the service rate per 1,000 members. Total services represents the total number of services received by members during the reporting year. The member count reports the total number of unique individuals who received at least one service during the reporting year. The service rate per 1,000 members is calculated by dividing the total number of services during the reporting year by the total sum of monthly member enrollments (provided in the data) and multiplying the result by 12,000. The metrics can be grouped by year, age, sex (assigned at birth), county of residence (including an option for Los Angeles Service Planning Areas, or SPAs), Covered California Region, and payer. 

Users can choose to view the data at two different levels. The most aggregate level groups the data by the eight main RBCS categories: Anesthesia, Durable Medical Equipment (DME), Evaluation and Management (E&M), Imaging, Procedure, Test, Treatment and Other. The second level breaks the eight aggregate RBCS categories into more specific subcategories.

2608,Physicians Actively Working by Specialty and Activity Hours,"These datasets contain aggregated responses from the HCAI Health Workforce License Renewal Survey  for Physician and Surgeon and Osteopathic Physician and Surgeon licensees. The data are limited to physicians whose license was in an Active Status   and who indicated they were actively working in a position that required their license as of April 3, 2025.

The license renewal survey utilizes a cell-based weighting methodology to estimate the total count of licensed individuals and accounts for individuals that decline to provide a response or who have not yet taken the survey. The presented estimated counts were calculated by multiplying county level weighted percentages for each metric by the total count of active licenses within each county.  If no physicians within a given specialty and county provided a response to the activity hours question, the statewide mode for that specialty was used.

Note: Previous versions of this dataset utilized raw counts rather than a cell-based weighting approach and did not take into account whether physicians were actively working in their field. 

In addition, the previous version of this dataset (as of April 3, 2024) contained errors regarding the total number of “Unsurveyed” individuals within each county.

__Laboratory surveillance data__: California laboratories report SARS-CoV-2 test results to CDPH through electronic laboratory reporting. Los Angeles County SARS-CoV-2 lab data has a 7-day reporting lag. Test positivity is calculated using SARS-CoV-2 lab tests that has a specimen collection date reported during a given week. Specimens for testing are collected from patients in healthcare settings and do not reflect all testing for COVID-19 in California. Test positivity for a given week is calculated by dividing the number of positive COVID-19 results by the total number of specimens tested for that virus. Weekly laboratory surveillance data are defined as Sunday through Saturday.

__Hospitalization data__: Data on COVID-19 and influenza hospital admissions are from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) Hospitalization dataset. The requirement to report COVID-19-associated hospitalizations was effective November 1, 2024. CDPH pulls NHSN data from the CDC on the Wednesday prior to the publication of the report. Results may differ depending on which day data are pulled. Admission rates are calculated using population estimates from the P-3: Complete State and County Projections Dataset (https://dof.ca.gov/forecasting/demographics/projections/) provided by the State of California Department of Finance. Reported weekly admission rates for the entire season use the population estimates for the year the season started. For more information on NHSN data including the protocol and data collection information, see the CDC NHSN webpage (https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/index.html). Weekly hospitalization data are defined as Sunday through Saturday.

__Death certificate data__: CDPH receives weekly year-to-date dynamic data on deaths occurring in California from the CDPH Center for Health Statistics and Informatics.

3103,WIC Participants by County,"The Women, Infants and Children (WIC) Program is a federally funded health and nutrition program that provides assistance to pregnant and postpartum individuals, infants, and children up to age five. WIC supports California families by offering:  

- Food benefits based on individual participants’ nutritional needs and risk assessment;
- Nutritional education and breastfeeding support;
- Healthcare referrals and other community services.

Participants must also meet income guidelines and other criteria. WIC local agencies (84 as of 2024) provide services monthly to approximately one million participants at 500 sites in local communities throughout the State. The food benefits can be used to purchase healthy supplemental foods from WIC authorized vendor stores throughout the State (about 3,700 in 2024). Certified WIC participants are individuals who have completed the eligibility and enrollment process and are approved to receive benefits and services. Participating WIC clients refer to certified individuals who are actively issued benefits during a specific reporting period.

There are three reports providing detailed information about WIC participants by year and month in California: (1) WIC Participants by County of Residence and by WIC Category; (2) WIC Participants by County of Residence and by Race/Ethnicity; and (3) WIC Participants by County of Residence, by WIC Category and by Race/Ethnicity.
